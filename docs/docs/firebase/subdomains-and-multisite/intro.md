# Introduction

In the situation where you want to have subdomains it is common to have the subdomain site as a different repository.

Firebase supports multiple sites on the same project and pointing a custom domain to act as a subdomain.

You would use this method if you had two github repos that you wanted to deploy to the same domain, with one as a subdomain.

## Deploying with Github Actions

Check out the docs in Github Actions -> [Firebase](/github-actions/firebase/index.md) for how to set up a Github Action to deploy your site.
