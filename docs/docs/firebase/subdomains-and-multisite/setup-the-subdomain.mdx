# Setup the Subdomain

[Official Docs](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting/custom-domain)

### Open your site manager

Go to the Firebase Console, select your project. Then click on Hosting in the left sidebar.

If you have not already added your second site, go to the [previous step](add-a-site.mdx).

Select the site you want to add as your subomain. Make sure you aren't adding the subdomain to the main site.

### Add custom domain

![Add Custom Domain](img/add-custom-domain.png)

Select "Add custom domain".

Enter the subdomain you want to use, including the domain name.

<details>
<summary>Adding redirects</summary>

You can choose to redirect here as well.

So for example, if I wanted to redirect `read-it-somewhere.bertramdesigns.com` to `rits.bertramdesigns.com`, I would check the box to Redirect.

You will still need to add these DNS records and the ones for the main subdomain (`rits`) to your domain provider.

</details>

This will supply you with the DNS records you need to add to your domain provider.

:::tip
If you need pause for any reason (like transferring the domain), you can "close for now" and it will give you a "needs setup" tag for you to fix later.

### Add the DNS records to your domain provider

I use Hostinger so I would go to Hostinger, select the domain, and add the records there.

:::note
The quick setup suggests adding a CNAME record for the subdomain. There are some indications that this may not work if you are have other Type-A records. Instead you can use the Advanced setup if there are issues. More information [here](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting/custom-domain#expandable-2)
