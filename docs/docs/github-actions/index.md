# Github Actions

Github Actions is a CI/CD tool that can be used to automate the build, test, and deployment of your code. For the most part I use it for deploying my code to different services like Firebase.

## Setting up Github Actions

Github actions exists in the `.github/workflows` directory in your repository.

Each added YAML file will create a new workflow in the action tab of Github.
