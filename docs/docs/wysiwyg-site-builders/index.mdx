# WYSIWYG Site Builders

<Infotip tip="**What you see is what you get**">WYSIWYG</Infotip> site generators
are useful for creating a website without needing too much coding experience.

The caveat of WYSIWYG site builders is the interface you use is an abstraction of code. This means you must compile the resulting designs into efficient and secure code. If the builder is proprietary, this is all magic happening behind the scenes without fuss. However, it means you are locked into the platform, not being able to use the data elsewhere.

As for cost, the more control you have over hosting and code, the less expensive the option.

There are pros and cons to a proprietary solution that fixes everything for you, so let's break it down.

Below you will find the possible solutions for hosting a website focusing on evaluating cost, longevity, and difficulty to help inform your approach to hosting your site. Within each category, you will find a guide to help you get started with tools I have explored.

## Types of WYSIWYG Site Builders

In general, there are three types of tools to build the your site:

**All-in-one online** - Online platform to build sites and easily deploy. There is no backup if you leave.\
**Flexible online** - These online apps typically have a hosting option, but also allow you to export the code.\
**Local** - A program you can install as an application on your computer, then export the code.

You can host in various ways, but not all are available for each type of tool. The options are:

**Through the tool/app** - The service you use to build the app hosts the site for you.\
**Self-hosted** - You upload your code to the server and configure it yourself.\
**"Creatively Hosted"** - Utilizing a design tool to "host" from a shared link... basically hosting through the app

### All-in-one Online

Let's start with the one you probably are quite familiar with. Platforms include:

- Squarespace
- Wix
- Webflow
- Framer

If you want a no hastle, no-code, no fuss, all-in-one solution is the way to go. However, you will pay for that convenience with a monthly fee.

These platforms usually offer great tools and templates. There is always a bit of a learning curve, but they generally require less time investment to manage and learn.

:::warning[THERE BE DRAGONS AHEAD]

If you are trying to make a quick or site, look no further. It is worth the cost and/or nuisance dealing with the platform always trying to upsell you.

All options from here in will require more time and effort to manage and maintain. Only continue if you are looking for a more controlled solution, are willing to learn to code a bit, and are willing to spend more time setting up the site before you can start designing.

### Flexible Online

When you start to think about a lot of these websites and how they work, they essentially generate a site and then link it to a <Infotip tip="Content Management System">CMS</Infotip> to display content
